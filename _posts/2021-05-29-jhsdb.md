***This is a draft post, work in progress:***

`jhsdb` is a Serviceability Agent (SA) tool. Serviceability Agent (SA) is a JDK component used to provide snapshot debugging, performance analysis and to get an in-depth understanding of the Hotspot JVM, and the Java application executed by the Hotspot JVM.

Even though native debuggers like gdb are available for examining the JVM, unlike jhsdb, these native debuggers do not have an inbuilt understanding of the data structures in Hotspot and hence, are not able to throw insights on the Java application being executed. jhsdb knows about the locations and address ranges of crucial components of the JVM like the Java heap, heap generations, regions, code cache, etc.

We use the `jhsdb` tool to attach to a hanged Java process or to a core dump from a crashed Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### Troubleshooting a Java Application with jhsdb

#### jhsdb modes

Following are 7 modes available in jhsdb

    jhsdb clhsdb    Starts the interactive command-line debugger.
    jhsdb debugd    Starts the remote debug server.
    jhsdb hsdb      Starts the interactive GUI debugger.
    jhsdb jstack    Prints stack and locks information.
    jhsdb jmap      Prints heap information.
    jhsdb jinfo     Prints basic JVM information.
    jhsdb jsnap     Prints performance counter information.


#### Structure of commands

Following is structure of commands to use with jhsdb.

    jhsdb clhsdb [--pid pid | --exe executable --core coredump]
    
    jhsdb debugd [options] (pid | executable coredump) [--serverid]
    
    jhsdb hsdb [--pid pid | --exe executable --core coredump]
    
    jhsdb jstack [--pid pid | --exe executable --core coredump] [options]
    
    jhsdb jmap [--pid pid | --exe executable --core coredump] [options]
    
    jhsdb jinfo [--pid pid | --exe executable --core coredump] [options]
    
    jhsdb jsnap [options] [--pid pid | --exe executable --core coredump]



\--pid

    The process ID to which the jhsdb tool should attach. 

\--serverid

    An optional unique ID to use when multiple debug servers are running on the same remote host.

\--exe

    The Java executable file from which the core dump was produced.

\--core

    The core dump file to which the jhsdb tool should attach.

options
    
    Each mode has its separate list of options, which we can see using help (e.g. jhsdb jstack --help)

<br>


#### Java program we will be debugging in this post

Following is the java class we are going to run and try to understand different features available in `jhsdb`.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.*;

public class DeadlockAOS
{
    private static Lock lock1 = new ReentrantLock();
    private static Lock lock2 = new ReentrantLock();
    private static int number_of_threads=2;

    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(number_of_threads);
        for (int i=0; i<number_of_threads/2; i++)
        {
            executorService.execute(new Task1());
            executorService.execute(new Task2());
        }

        executorService.shutdown();

    }

    static class Task1 implements Runnable
    {
        @Override
        public void run()
        {
            while(true)
            {
                try
                {
                    lock1.lock();
                    lock2.lock();
                }
                catch(Exception e)
                {
                    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
                }

                finally
                {
                    lock1.unlock();
                    lock2.unlock();
                }
            }

        }

    }

    static class Task2 implements Runnable
    {
        @Override
        public void run()
        {
            while(true)
            {
                try
                {
                    lock2.lock();
                    lock1.lock();
                }
                catch(Exception e)
                {
                    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
                }

                finally
                {
                    lock2.unlock();
                    lock1.unlock();
                }

            }
        }

    }

}
```

For all our examples we will be using Java 17, as of writing this post it is built using [JDK master branch](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/). [This post](https://jfeatures.com/blog/OpenJDK_Contribution) explains how to build JDK from the source.

    java -version
    openjdk version "17-internal" 2021-09-14
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17-internal+0-adhoc.vipin.jdk)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17-internal+0-adhoc.vipin.jdk, mixed mode)

### Connecting jhsdb with Java process

Following are three ways to connect `jhsdb` with a Java process:

1. --pid option: Provide process id to connect with process (e.g. jhsdb jstack --pid 1234)
2. --core option: Use core dump file to connect with process (e.g. jhsdb jstack --core ./core.1234 --exe ./myexe)
3. --connect option: Start debug server using `jhsdb debugd` and use connect option (e.g. jhsdb jstack --connect id@debugserver:1234)

<br>

#### Using pid to connect with a hanged process

It is important to note we are trying to connect with a hanged process, if process is running it may get hang after we connect with `jhsdb`.
Following command connects jhsdb with a java process and executes it in `jstack` mode to get thread dump:

    jhsdb jstack --pid 26697

Following are some command showing clhsdb mode.

This is command to connect jhsdb with pid 26697

    jhsdb clhsdb --pid 26697
    Attaching to process 26697, please wait...

After attaching jhsdb `threads` command fetches list of threads along with thread ids.

    hsdb> threads

#### Connecting jhsdb with core dump file

When Java process has generated core dump file, we can connect this with jhsdb and do further analysis e.g. take thread dump, heap dump.

First command to connect jhsdb with core dump file, filename: core

    jhsdb clhsdb --core ./core --exe /home/vipin/githubprojects/jdk/build/linux-x86_64-server-fastdebug/jdk/bin/java
    Opening core file, please wait...

This is command to get list of threads along with thread ids.

#### Starting debugd server and connecting using --connect option

<!-- 
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8224979
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8196751
-->

Following is command to start debug server:

    jhsdb debugd --pid 5069 --serverid test

This is command to connect with the server we started in above thread:

    jhsdb jstack --connect test@localhost

Following is command to connect jhsdb in clhsdb mode, after this we can use all the `clhsdb` specific commands.

    jhsdb clhsdb --pid 48584

<br>

### Conclusion

Utilities like this are very useful in a situation when we need to analyze and resolve problems in production Java application quickly. `jhsdb` is an amazing utility part of JDK itself, no need to install any third party software.
