## Java 14 feature Records
  Switch expression is one of the best feature introduced with Java14, it is in preview mode.

To use preview feature we need to pass --enable-preview parameter. Sample command to execute RecordsJDK14.java is:    

     javac --enable-preview -source 14 com/vip/jdk14/JavaRecords.java
     java --enable-preview com.vip.jdk14.JavaRecords

<br>

### Summary of Records from [JEP-359](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359) :    
> Enhance the Java programming language with records. Records provide a compact syntax for declaring classes > which are transparent holders for shallowly immutable data. This is a preview language feature in Java 14.    

### Goal of records from [JEP-359](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359) page:
> While it is superficially tempting to treat records as primarily being about boilerplate reduction, we instead choose a more semantic goal: modeling data as data. (If the semantics are right, the boilerplate will take care of itself.) It should be easy, clear, and concise to declare shallowly-immutable, well-behaved nominal data aggregates.    

<br>

### Java 14 Records:

To write even a simple data carrier class we have to write lot of boilerplate code. Like constructors, accessors, equals(), hashCode(), toString(), etc.   

```java
java final class Point
{
 public final int x;   
 public final int y;    
 public Point(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }    
 public int getX() {...}   
 public int getY() {...}   
 public String toString() {...}   
 public boolean equals(Object o) {...}   
 public int hashCode() {...)  
}
```


Java record equivalent for class Point is following one liner :   
```java
record Point(int x, int y){}
```

Lets try to see what java added in Record Point, we will use javap for this.

```
javac  --enable-preview -source 14 Point.java
javap -p Point.class

Compiled from "Point.java"
public final class com.vip.jdk14.Point extends java.lang.Record {
  private final int x;
  private final int y;
  public com.vip.jdk14.Point(int, int);
  public java.lang.String toString();
  public final int hashCode();
  public final boolean equals(java.lang.Object);
  public int x();
  public int y();
}
```

In output of above javap command we can see following are properties of Records, Records have:   

1. A private final field for each component of the state description.  (In above example private final int x, private final int y)
2. A public read accessor method for each parameter of Record, with the same name and type as the parameter. (public int x(), public int y())  
3. A public constructor, whose signature is the same as the state description, which initializes each field from the corresponding argument. (public com.vip.jdk14.Point(int, int))
4. Implementations of equals and hashCode that say two records are equal if they are of the same type and contain the same state. (we can see in example above)  
5. An implementation of toString that includes the string representation of all the record components, with their names.  (we can see in example above)

Records behave like normal classes except restrictions, following are few properties of the Records:
1.	They can be declared top level or nested, they can be generic.
2.	They can implement interfaces.
3.	They are instantiated via the new keyword.
4.	The record's body may declare static methods, static fields, static initializers, constructors, instance methods, and nested types.
5.	The record, and the individual components in a state description, may be annotated.
6.	We can define a nested record, which is implicitly static; this avoids an immediately enclosing instance which would silently add state to the record.

Records have 3 type of constructors we can define explicitly:
1.  Canonical constructor (The one whose signature matches the record's state description)
2.  Compact constructor (always called when defined)
3.  Custom constructor. (All except above 2)

```java
record NameValue(String name, int value) {
    //canonical constructor (the one whose signature matches the record's state description)
    public NameValue(String name, int value) {
        this.name = name;
        this.value = value;
    }    
    //compact constructor, always called when defined.
    public NameValue {
        if(value == 1) throw new RuntimeException(""); //throwing Exception whenever value is 1
    }       
    // Custom constructor
    public NameValue(int value) {
        this(null, value); // Necessary to avoid compilation error
        if(value == 2) throw new RuntimeException("");
    }
}
```

<br>

### Restrictions on Record:   
 Following code throws compilation error in extends, because Records are implicitly final.
```
java record Base(int a) { } record Child(int a, int b) extends Base { }
```    
Similarly we have few more restrictions to follow for Records.

 Restrictions on records can be divided in 3 categories:    
1. Restrictions that ensure the state description alone defines the representation     
   1. Records cannot extend any other class    
   2. Records cannot declare instance fields other than the private final fields which correspond to components     
    of the state description. Any other fields which are declared must be static.    
2. Restrictions that emphasize the API of a record is defined solely by its state description,     
and cannot be enhanced later by another class or record.    
   1. Records are implicitly final.    
   2. Records cannot be abstract.     
3. This restriction embodies an immutable by default policy.    
   1. The components of a record are implicitly final.    


<br>

### Imp use cases for Records:

**1. Multiple return values:** Often we encounter cases when we want to return multiple values from method,     
for this we will have to create a class having these values we need to return.     
Records provide a easy way rather than writing boilerplate code.     
Some language provide tuple as solution for such case but java records having better readable names     
for members makes them better than tuple.    

**2. Data transfer objects (DTO):** Developers working with databases often write DTO which typically used for only storage, we can again reduce boilerplate code using java records.    

<br>

### Why Record why not just tuples?    
A central aspect of Java's philosophy is that "names" matter.  A `Person` with properties `firstName` and `lastName` is clearer and safer than a tuple of `String` and `String`.
