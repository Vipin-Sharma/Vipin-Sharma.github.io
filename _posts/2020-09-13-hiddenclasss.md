### What are Hidden classes in Java 15
In Simple words classes that cannot be used directly by the bytecode of other classes are hidden classes.

Hidden classes allow frameworks/JVM languages to define classes as 
non-discoverable implementation details, so that they ***cannot*** be linked against 
by other classes.

<!--Hidden classes cannot be symbolically referenced by other classes.--> 
The following are a few properties of hidden class which also help us understand hidden classes. 
1. cannot be named as a supertype
2. cannot be a declaring field type
3. cannot be the parameter type or the return type 
4. cannot be found by classloader via `Class::forName`, `ClassLoader::loadClass`, 
`Lookup::findClass` etc.


<!--
Deprecate the non-standard API sun.misc.Unsafe::defineAnonymousClass, with the 
intent to deprecate it for removal in a future release. -->

### Why do we need this new language feature

Framework/Language implementors usually intend for a dynamically generated class to be 
logically part of the implementation of a statically generated class. 
For this intent following are properties that are desirable for dynamically generated classes:


1. ***Non-discoverability***
Dynamically generated classes should not be discoverable by other classes in JVM.
(e.g. using Class::forName and ClassLoader::loadClass)

2. ***Access control***
An access control nest with non-discoverable classes, for example the host class mechanism 
in Unsafe.defineAnonymousClass(), where a dynamically loaded class can use the 
access control context of a host. [More on Java 11 feature nest based access control](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/181) 

3. ***Lifecycle*** 
Dynamically generated classes may only be needed for a limited time, 
so retaining them for the lifetime of the statically generated class might 
unnecessarily increase memory footprint. Existing workarounds for this situation, 
such as per-class class loaders, are cumbersome and inefficient.


Existing standard APIs `ClassLoader::defineClass` and `Lookup::defineClass`, always define 
a visible/discoverable class, and in this way classes have a longer lifecycle than desired.
Hidden classes have all the above 3 features desired by Framework/Language implementors.

### Current alternative for hidden classes sun.misc.Unsafe::defineAnonymousClass

Many language implementations built on the JVM rely upon dynamic class generation 
for flexibility and efficiency.
Before Java15, non-standard API `sun.misc.Unsafe::defineAnonymousClass` was 
used to generate dynamic classes.
We know ***Unsafe APIs are not recommended***.

Now we have standard API `Lookup::defineHiddenClass` to create Hidden classes. 
`sun.misc.Unsafe::defineAnonymousClass` is deprecated since Java 15.
It is important to note in Java 15 hidden classes are not a complete replacement for `sun.misc.Unsafe::defineAnonymousClass`

Few differences between Hidden classes and `sun.misc.Unsafe::defineAnonymousClass` are:
1. Hidden classes do not support constant-pool patching. 
JDK team is working on this [<ins>enhancement</ins>](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/valhalla-dev/2020-November/008251.html)
2. VM-anonymous classes (created using `sun.misc.Unsafe::defineAnonymousClass`) have self optimization ability for hotspot JVM.
3. A VM-anonymous class can access protected members of its host class even if the 
VM-anonymous class exists in a different run-time package and is not a subclass of the host class.
4. A hidden class can join a nest at run time, a normal class cannot. 
A nest is a set of classes that allow access to each other's private members but 
without any of the backdoor accessibility-broadening methods usually associated 
with nested classes in the Java language, it was introduced in Java 11.  

The best example for use of Hidden classes is lambda expressions in Java language.
JDK developers don't want to expose classes generated by lambda expression so
javac is not translating lambda expression into dedicated class, it generates 
bytecode that dynamically generates and instantiates a class to yield an object
corresponding to the lambda expression when needed.

<!-- Before Java 15 for Lambda expressions `sun.misc.Unsafe::defineAnonymousClass` was used in JDK. 
Since Java 15 lambda expression are using Hidden classes.-->

### How to write Hidden classes

<!--
A hidden class specific way to have a defining class loader. 
This is necessary to resolve types used by the hidden class's own fields and methods. 
In particular, a hidden class has the same defining class loader, runtime package, 
and protection domain as the lookup class, which is the class that originally 
obtained the lookup object on which Lookup::defineHiddenClass is invoked. 
-->

<!--Hidden classes have different handling of classloaders, that makes it non discoverable to other classes.-->

The hidden class is created by invoking Lookup::defineHiddenClass.
This causes the JVM to derive a hidden class from the supplied bytes, link the hidden class 
and return a lookup object that provides reflective access to the hidden class.
The invoking program should store the lookup object carefully,
as it is the only way to obtain the Class object of the hidden class.

```java
public class HiddenClassDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {
        // Step 1: Create lookup object.
        MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
        
        //Step 2: get ClassWriter objects and then covert that into byte array.
        // Here we are creating class implementing interface Test. 
        // For more details, Look at method GenerateClass.getClassWriter, link https://github.com/Vipin-Sharma/JDK15Examples/blob/master/src/main/java/com/vip/jfeatures/jdk15/hiddenclass/GenerateClass.java#L22
        ClassWriter cw = GenerateClass.getClassWriter(HiddenClassDemo.class);
        byte[] bytes = cw.toByteArray();
        
        //Sep 3: This is step creating Hidden class, It is important to note the invoking program should store the 
        // lookup object carefully, for it is the only way to obtain the Class object of the hidden class.
        Class<?> c = lookup.defineHiddenClass(bytes, true, NESTMATE).lookupClass();
        
        //Step 4: Creating constructor then Object of type Test and calling a simple function test. 
        Constructor<?> constructor = c.getConstructor(null);
        Object object = constructor.newInstance(null);
        Test test = (Test) object;
        test.test(new String[]{""});
        System.out.println("End of main method in class " + HiddenClassDemo.class.getName());
    }
}
```

```java
public interface Test {
    void test(String[] args);
}
```

```java
public static ClassWriter getClassWriter(Class<HiddenClassDemo> ownerClassName) {
        ClassWriter cw = new ClassWriter(ClassWriter.COMPUTE_MAXS);

        cw.visit(V1_6, ACC_PUBLIC + ACC_SUPER, getHiddenClassName(ownerClassName),
                null, "java/lang/Object", new String[] {"com/vip/jfeatures/jdk15/hiddenclass/Test"});
        ...
        ...
        ...
            MethodVisitor mv = cw.visitMethod(ACC_PUBLIC, "test",
                                "([Ljava/lang/String;)V", null, null);
            mv.visitCode();
            mv.visitFieldInsn(GETSTATIC, "java/lang/System", "out", "Ljava/io/PrintStream;");
            mv.visitLdcInsn("Hello test");
            mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEVIRTUAL, "java/io/PrintStream", "println", "(Ljava/lang/String;)V");
            mv.visitInsn(RETURN);
            mv.visitMaxs(2, 1);
            mv.visitEnd();        

    }
```
