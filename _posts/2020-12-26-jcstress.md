### What is JCStress:

<!--The JCStress is the experimental harness and a suite of tests to aid the research in the correctness of concurrency support in the JVM, class libraries, and hardware.-->

Concurrent code is hard to test, it is possible some code works for years and one bad day it fails. 
For this JCStress is a stress test framework for concurrent programs developed by JDK developers.

### Starting with first JCStress test

Following are important annotations to understanding our first JCStress test.

    @Actor	: It annotates methods that hold the actions done by the threads.
    
    @State  : It annotates the class that holds the data mutated/read by the tests.
    
    @Result	: This annotation marks the result object.
    
    @JCStressTest	: Mark the class as JCStress test.
    
    @Outcome    : It describes the test outcome, and how to deal with it.

    
<!-- The invariants that are maintained by the infrastructure are as follows:
 
    Each method is called only by one particular thread.
    Each method is called exactly once per {@link State} instance.

Note that the invocation order against other {@link Actor} methods is deliberately not specified.
Actions in Actor annotated method is executed by thread and thread has access to @State and @Result.-->

<!--Some possible  outcome is ACCEPTABLE, ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING, FORBIDDEN.-->

This is basic example of JCStress test using API components we discussed.

```java
@JCStressTest

// These are the test outcomes.
@Outcome(id = "1, 1", expect = Expect.ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING, desc = "Both actors came up with the same value: atomicity failure.")
@Outcome(id = "1, 2", expect = Expect.ACCEPTABLE, desc = "actor1 incremented, then actor2.")
@Outcome(id = "2, 1", expect = Expect.ACCEPTABLE, desc = "actor2 incremented, then actor1.")

// This is a state object
@State
public class APISample_01_Simple {

    int v;

    @Actor
    public void actor1(II_Result r) {
        r.r1 = ++v; // record result from actor1 to field r1
    }

    @Actor
    public void actor2(II_Result r) {
        r.r2 = ++v; // record result from actor2 to field r2
    }

}
```

Following are few important points about the above test:

1. Class APISample_01_Simple has field int v, it is annotated with @State, and it stores state of object.

2. Class II_Result is annotated with @Result, to store result of test it usages 2 int type fields r1 and r2.

3. For each test executed: 
    1. Methods actor1 and actor2 are executed exactly once.
    2. Methods actor1 and actor2 are called by particular threads, e.g. Thread t1 calls actor1 and Thread t2 calls actor2.
    3. Per @State object (here instance of APISample_01_Simple) JCStress framework calls actor1 and actor2 only once.
    4. The invocation order of methods actor1 and actor2 is deliberately not specified.
    5. It stores state in the same instance of APISample_01_Simple and records result in same instance of II_Result.
    6. Result is available in the instance of II_Result after actor1 and actor2 are completed.

4. @Result annotated class II_Result contains instance variables r1 and r2. Depending upon output of the test we tag it with corresponding Expected value.
e.g. for r1=1 and r2=2, result is Expect.ACCEPTABLE.
     for r1=1 and r2=1, result is Expect.ACCEPTABLE_INTERESTING.

### Setting up project and how to run JCStress test

Create standalone JCStress project using maven archetype, for this you need maven and JDK 8+.

    mvn archetype:generate \
     -DinteractiveMode=false \
     -DarchetypeGroupId=org.openjdk.jcstress \
     -DarchetypeArtifactId=jcstress-java-test-archetype \
     -DgroupId=com.jfeatures \
     -DartifactId=jcstresstest \
     -Dversion=1.0

[This](https://github.com/Vipin-Sharma/jcstresstest) is Github project created using above command.

Running tests, if we have not created any test it will execute default test available.

    cd jcstresstest
    mvn clean verify
    java -jar target/jcstress.jar

In case we want to execute a particular test use -t option like below
    
    java -jar target/jcstress.jar ConcurrencyTest

Open test report:

    firefox results/index.html

### More JCStress APIs

JCStress provides useful APIs to develop Java concurrency tests. This sections we are going to discuss these APIs and how they solve different type of problems.

#### Using Result classes in JCStress
JCStress ships lots of pre-canned result classes. e.g. II_Result and III_Result, here I represent an int.
Similarly, following is list of different letters used in JCStress result classes.

    I 	: 	int
    Z 	: 	boolean
    F	:	float
    J	:	long
    S	: 	short
    B	:	byte
    C	:	char
    D	:	double
    L	:	object

With help of this we can try to find pre canned Result class in JCStress.
e.g 
1. for Result having int(I) and boolean(Z) we can use IZ_Result.
2. for Result having float(F) and long(J) we can use FJ_Result.

#### Arbiters
Method annotated with @Arbiter run after all method annotated with @Actor, and therefore can observe the final result. [This](https://github.com/openjdk/jcstress/blob/master/jcstress-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jcstress/samples/APISample_02_Arbiters.java) is sample test using Arbiters.

#### Signal
Signal is useful for delivering a termination signal to Actor in Mode.Termination tests. It will run after Actor in question started executing. For termination test we use annotation @JCStressTest(Mode.Termination).
[This](https://github.com/openjdk/jcstress/blob/master/jcstress-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jcstress/samples/APISample_03_Termination.java) is sample test using Signal.

#### Nested tests
It is sometimes convenient to put the tests in the same source file for better comparison. JCStress allows to nest the tests. [This](https://github.com/openjdk/jcstress/blob/master/jcstress-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jcstress/samples/APISample_04_Nesting.java) is sample test showing nested tests in JCStress.

#### Shared Metadata
When tests share the outcomes and other metadata. To use common metadata for such tests, there is a special @JCStressMeta annotation that can use metadata of another class.
[This](https://github.com/openjdk/jcstress/blob/master/jcstress-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jcstress/samples/APISample_05_SharedMetadata.java)

#### Adding test descriptions and references
JCStress also allows to put the descriptions and references right at the test. This helps to identify the goal for the test, as well as the discussions about the behavior in question.

Following example showing how we can add test descriptions and references

    @Description("Sample Hello World test")
    @Ref("http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcstress/")

### VM options and arguments used by JCStress

#### Vm options -XX:+StressLCM -XX:+StressGCM
LCM / GCM stands for Local Code Motion / Global Code Motion. To optimize CPU utilization, compiler may reorder independent instructions without changing the semantics of the code. Compiler tries to find the most optimal (from performance perspective) order of instructions. This is called instruction scheduling, and that's what LCM / GCM do.

With -XX:+StressLCM / -XX:+StressGCM options the instruction scheduling works in a bit different way. It no longer tries to find the best schedule, but instead chooses a random instruction order within the allowed constraints, still keeping the original semantics unchanged. Such nondeterministic behavior helps to test more combinations of instruction interleaving, which is essential in finding subtle concurrency issues.

#### Vm options -XX:-TieredCompilation -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1
Use -XX:-TieredCompilation or -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 to disable C1 or C2 respectively.

#### Vm option -Xint
Runs the application in interpreted-only mode. Compilation to native code is disabled, and all bytecode is executed by the interpreter. The performance benefits offered by the just in time (JIT) compiler are not present in this mode.

#### Argument -m
It sets test mode preset: sanity, quick, default, tough, stress. <!--These modes go from minimum to max rigorous in the same order give here.--> 

    java -jar target/jcstress.jar -t ConcurrencyTest -m sanity
    java -jar target/jcstress.jar -t ConcurrencyTest -m quick
    java -jar target/jcstress.jar -t ConcurrencyTest -m default
    java -jar target/jcstress.jar -t ConcurrencyTest -m tough
    java -jar target/jcstress.jar -t ConcurrencyTest -m stress

<!-- what is Stride, given in result along with vm options-->
