The initial draft, work in progress.

<!-- Attention -->
### What is project Panama

<!--Project Panama is designed to incubate a series of components for eventual inclusion in the JDK, via curated merge.-->
Project Panama improves connections between the Java virtual machine and (non-Java) APIs, it mainly includes features around native calls, memory access.

Project panama has two repositories panama-foreign support and panama vector support both targets different features.

#### Panama foreign support: It contains the following active branches:

~~1. foreign-memaccess, this branch adds support for foreign memory access;~~
~~2. foreign-abi, this branch adds support for foreign function calls;~~
1. foreign-memaccess+abi : This branch adds support for foreign memory access and foreign function calls. Recently foreign-memaccess and foreign-abi are merged into one, this will be parent branch for foreign-jextract.
2. foreign-jextract, this branch provides a tool (jextract) which mechanically generates Java bindings from native library headers.



#### Panama vector support: It contains the following active branch:
1. vectorIntrinsics: This branch adds vectorization support in Java through JVM intrinsics.

Intrinsic function: (source: Wikipedia)

In computer software, in compiler theory, an intrinsic function (or builtin function) is a function (subroutine) available for use in a given programming language whose implementation is handled specially by the compiler. Typically, it may substitute a sequence of automatically generated instructions for the original function call, similar to an inline function. Unlike an inline function, the compiler has an intimate knowledge of an intrinsic function and can thus better integrate and optimize it for a given situation.

### Why do we need this project panama

Currently, we can use Java Native Interface (JNI) to make native calls. 
<!-- in some cases we can use `sun.misc.Unsafe` as well. -->

3.    [Panama jextract usage examples](https://github.com/openjdk/panama-foreign/blob/foreign-jextract/doc/panama_jextract.md)


### Panama foreign support

It adds support for native function calls from JVM, native memory access, native oriented JIT optimizations, and many other things to improve native calls from JVM.

Currently, 2 java enhancement proposals are in progress as Incubator release.

1. [Foreign-Memory Access API](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/393)
2. [Foreign Linker API](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/389)

<br>

#### what is Incubator release:

Some language features are released as [incubator modules](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/11) in JDK, these feature will be released as standard features after improvements and stabilization in a couple of releases. During this time users can provide their feedback, some API could be dropped completely and new better versions can be added.

<br>

### Current alternative for project panama
<!--JNA, JNR and BridJ are popular libraries which are wrapper around JNI so Java developers 
can write java code to make native calls.-->

<br>
